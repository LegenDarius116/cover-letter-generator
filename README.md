# Darius's Cover Letter Generator

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The aim of this project was to simplify the tailoring and generation of cover letters as I pursue employment in Software Development post-graduation. Currently, it takes data on the company and the role and plugs it into a predefined template.

The data takes is:
* Company name
* Role title
* Short description of the role
* Short blurb about the company and/or it's product

This project is a work in progress, and I will be actively changing this as my needs change.
